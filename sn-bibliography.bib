To dispose mineral tailings in a technical, environmental and economical way, the cemented paste backfill (CPB) technology is proposed and widely adopted. Here we summarize recent progress in CPB design, with particular emphasis on flocculation and sedimentation, CPB mix design and CPB pipe transport. We provide an updated picture of underlying mechanisms, experimental techniques, influencing factors and recent frontiers for each abovementioned process. The review concludes with some future directions for the field. We envisage a future in which the CPB design is optimised in an integrated CPB design system, accelerated by artificial intelligence and interpreted using atomic simulation.}

ABSTRACT = {With the development of science and technology, backfill technology has made continuous progress, and the traditional backfill method is no longer suitable for various complicated practical engineering situations. Therefore, researchers in the field of backfill mining have gradually shifted their research focus to the study of high-concentration backfill, and Chinese researchers are no exception. In order to solve the problems caused by the traditional backfill method, China began to vigorously develop high-concentration backfill in recent years, and achieved a lot of results. In this paper, some important achievements made by Chinese researchers on high-concentration backfill in recent years are reviewed; it also presents a summary report of the latest research results from several key laboratories across China. Therefore, this paper reviews the development progress of high-concentration backfill China has made, of which the main contents include: (1) research progress of the high-concentration backfill theory in China; and (2) research progress of high-concentration backfill equipment in China. Finally, we claim that this paper serves just as a guide to start a conversation, and we hope many more experts and scholars will be interested and engage in the research of this field.},

abstract = {Mixing plays an important role in paste filling technology, but there exists poor flowability of paste and low strength of cement paste backfill in production, which is due to the fact that the material is not evenly dispersed in the mixing process. In this paper, the flow behavior of paste was simulated by the discrete element method (DEM) during mixing process, and the parameters of the particle contact model were calibrated by rheological tests and slump tests. It can be seen that there was a good correlation between the flow behavior and the simulation. The surface energy was set to 4.8¬†J/m3, which could reflect the interparticle force. It was found that the particle agglomeration affected the particle motion, while the van der Waals and electrostatic forces influenced the particle interactions under shearing. The average coordination number of particles showed an increasing trend at t¬†=¬†45¬†s, as did the contact force between particles. This study provides new insight into the mechanism of mesostructure evolution of the paste under strong shearing and lays the foundation for quantifying the effect of inter-particle mechanical interaction on the fluidity of the paste.}

abstract = {Mixing is a ubiquitous operation in process engineering. It is not only used for combining materials, but also for promoting heat and mass transfer, increasing aeration, suspending solids, and modifying material structure. Measurement techniques have the potential to optimise industrial mixing processes and improve product quality by monitoring critical process parameters. Real-time sensing techniques that do not require manual material sampling are of particular interest owing to their automatic data acquisition capability. This makes them suitable for use in control systems for process automation and eventually as connected sensors in Industry 4.0. This review article focuses on these measurement techniques, defined as in- and on-line, along with their capability for implementation in industrial processes. The applications reviewed include liquid‚Äìliquid, gas‚Äìliquid, solid‚Äìliquid, solid‚Äìgas‚Äìliquid, in addition to solids blending. A technique selection section discussing the decision-making process when choosing a sensor and a summary table including the advantages, disadvantages, applications and limitations of each technique are provided. The article concludes by discussing the future of monitoring techniques for mixing processes.}

abstract = {A new image analysis technique coupled with the power consumption were employed in this paper and proved to be a relevant method to detect the different characteristic times of the mixing evolution, i.e. the cohesion time, the fluidity time and the half-life time of the mixture evolution after fluidity. It was shown that the ‚Äúeffective water-to-powder ratio in the mortar‚Äù which excludes from the effective water the quantity of water needed to fill the less compact packing in the vicinity of the coarse aggregates, governed the mixing behaviour before fluidity and the interval of water content where the concrete mixture behaves as a homogenous and fluid granular suspension. It was also shown that the mixing behaviour was adversely affected by the amount of water into the mixture. The fluidity and cohesive times were faster to be obtained when the water proportion was increased. At opposite, it was more difficult to obtain the final consistency for a more fluid mixture, at given super-plasticizer proportioning. As a general remark, the behaviour seemed controlled by the mixture composition before the fluidity point and by the mixture consistency after the fluidity point. To end, the image analysis technique coupled with the mixing power technique can be employed at the end of the mixing to complete the information obtained with the other methods of analysis in order to monitor the consistency of the mixture. But, the use of the cohesion and fluidity times, easy to detect with the texture analysis, could be more efficient monitoring tools from an industrial point of view.}

abstract = {Current technical knowledge is insufficient regarding the influence of mixing time on fresh and hardened properties of cemented paste backfill (CPB). This work focused on experimental studies to gain a deeper understanding of the influence of mixing time on the rheological properties (yield stress, viscosity), self-desiccation, permeability and mechanical properties or behavior (strength, deformation behavior) of CPB. A series of CPB specimens were prepared with various mixing times (1, 2, 4, 7, 10, and 15¬†min) and cured at different times (1, 2, 4, 7, 10 and 15¬†min) for rheological property testing. Unconfined compressive strength (UCS), hydraulic conductivity and microstructural tests were performed on CPBs that were made with various mixing times and cured for different times (up to 90¬†days). Monitoring experiments were also carried out on CPBs prepared with various mixing times. The results obtained indicate that the mixing time significantly affects the rheological, mechanical, hydraulic and microstructural properties of CPB. Moreover, the self-desiccation of CPB is a function of the mixing time. A longer mixing time increased the yield stress and decreased the viscosity. The longer mixing time promoted binder dissolution and hydration in the CPB, which increased the amount of hydration products and decreased the volumetric water. Longer mixing time intensified the CPB self-desiccation, which is beneficial for the early age mechanical strength of CPB. CPB specimens made with longer mixing time experienced a higher strength and elastic modulus due to the generation of more cement hydration products and the reduction of the volume of pores in CPB. A longer mixing time reduced the CPB hydraulic conductivity, due to the refinement of the CPB pore structure. This study provides relevant knowledge and technical information that will contribute to the design of more cost-effective and sustainable CPB structures.}

abstract = {The general aim of multi-focus image fusion is to gather focused regions of different images to generate a unique all-in-focus fused image. Deep learning based methods become the mainstream of image fusion by virtue of its powerful feature representation ability. However, most of the existing deep learning structures failed to balance fusion quality and end-to-end implementation convenience. End-to-end decoder design often leads to unrealistic result because of its non-linear mapping mechanism. On the other hand, generating an intermediate decision map achieves better quality for the fused image, but relies on the rectification with empirical post-processing parameter choices. In this work, to handle the requirements of both output image quality and comprehensive simplicity of structure implementation, we propose a cascade network to simultaneously generate decision map and fused result with an end-to-end training procedure. It avoids the dependence on empirical post-processing methods in the inference stage. To improve the fusion quality, we introduce a gradient aware loss function to preserve gradient information in output fused image. In addition, we design a decision calibration strategy to decrease the time consumption in the application of multiple images fusion. Extensive experiments are conducted to compare with 19 different state-of-the-art multi-focus image fusion structures with 6 assessment metrics. The results prove that our designed structure can generally ameliorate the output fused image quality, while implementation efficiency increases over 30% for multiple images fusion.}
